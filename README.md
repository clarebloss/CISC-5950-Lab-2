### Question 1
For each player, we define the comfortable zone of shooting as a matrix of {SHOT_DIST, CLOSE_DEF_DIST, SHOT_CLOCK}. Please develop a K-Means algorithm to classify each player's records into 4 comfortable zones. Considering the hit rate, which zone is the best for James Harden, Chris Paul, Stephen Curry, and Lebron James.


### Question 2
Consider a Black vehicle parking illegally at street codes 34510, 10030, 34050. What is the probability that it will get a ticket (using a very rough prediction)?


### Question 3
When are tickets most likely to be issued?
